# Color Picker


## The Goal


My **goal** with this project was to create a website where a user could interact with a color picker by adjusting values for hue, saturation, and lightness using a slider. I wanted the user to be able to save values they liked, and see the HSL (hue, saturation, lightness) value in addition to the color, this would allow them to find these colors more quickly if they wanted to use them on a project some time.

## Behind the Scenes


I used [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) to organize my code and write the program in JSX, which allowed me to write my HTML and CSS within javascript. React also helps to steer developers toward more Object-Oriented-Programming, which is a good habit to develop.
The text editor I used was [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
